Patterns are the default blank templates used when creating new nouns/verbs, etc.
For instance, when creating a new page, the server will create copies of the config and page template from here. (Think of symphony/template/*.tpl and page.xsl files). They are kept here so developers can set their own default template patterns so they do not need to copy and paste their own customized blank pages).
