One of the biggest issues with complicated CMSs is that they rarely include documentation to help users remember where things are, and instead rely on user knowledge (which is often lacking) to figure out how to do things. Since Grammar CMS’s admin panel (for lack of a better term) will be highly customized depending on what the site needs are, documentation to help users along is absolutely critical and must be baked in. This will add complications to the developer, but we’re not paid to make life easy for ourselves. We’re supposed to make life easy for everyone else.
