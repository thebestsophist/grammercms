Pages each page will have at least two files associated with them:
- *config*: which attaches user permissions, adjectives, data sources, &c to a page, as well as define what sort of page is rendered (server codes, content-type, and the like)
- *template*: Which is the template that defines how a "page" is supposed to be rendered
